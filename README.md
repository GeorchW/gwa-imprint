# Imprint Repo

This is a React-based imprint that I'm using in multiple projects.
My own address is encrypted within it to prevent easy scraping, requiring the answer to a simple question to reveal the address data.
The question/answer (as well as the address data) is static.

I might need to switch to a proper image captcha if scrapers are starting to use GPT-3 for their purposes :-) .
